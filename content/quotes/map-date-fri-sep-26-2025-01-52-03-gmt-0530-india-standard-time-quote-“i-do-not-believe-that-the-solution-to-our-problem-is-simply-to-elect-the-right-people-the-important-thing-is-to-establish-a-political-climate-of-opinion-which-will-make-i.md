  “I do not believe that the solution to our problem is simply to elect the
  right people. The important thing is to establish a political climate of
  opinion which will make it politically profitable for the wrong people to do
  the right thing. Unless it is politically profitable for the wrong people to
  do the right thing, the right people will not do the right thing either, or if
  they try, they will shortly be out of office.”
